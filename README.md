# Puppet module for managing the Foreman Smart Proxy

Installs and configures the Foreman Smart Proxy and services that it can
interact with, e.g. DNS, DHCP and Puppet and TFTP.

Part of the Foreman installer: <https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-installer>

## PowerDNS support

To use the PowerDNS plugin, the following variables need to be set on the main
`foreman_proxy` class.

    $dns          => true
    $dns_managed  => false
    $dns_provider => 'powerdns'

Then you also need to include `foreman_proxy::plugin::dns::powerdns`.

The powerdns plugin can optionally manage the database. If that's used, then
the puppetlabs-mysql module must be added to the modulepath, otherwise it's not
required.

## Compatibility

This module only supports Smart Proxy 1.12 or higher as of version 4.0, as the
configuration layout changed significantly.

To configure older versions of the Smart Proxy use version 2.x of this module
for 1.5 to 1.10 and 3.x for 1.11.

### 1.16 compatibility notes

On Smart Proxy 1.16+ with puppetca support, also set:

    use_autosignfile => true,

to ensure the new `autosignfile` parameter is used instead of `puppetdir`.

### 1.15 compatibility notes

On Smart Proxy 1.15+ with realm support, also set:

    realm_split_config_files => true,

to ensure the new separate `realm.yml` and `realm_freeipa.yaml` files are
configured correctly.

## Examples

### Minimal setup for Puppet/PuppetCA Smart Proxy

```puppet
class{'::foreman_proxy':
  puppet   => true,
  puppetca => true,
  tftp     => false,
  dhcp     => false,
  dns      => false,
  bmc      => false,
  realm    => false,
}
```
