# Puppet module for managing the Foreman Smart Proxy

Installs and configures the Foreman Smart Proxy and services that it can
interact with, e.g. DNS, DHCP and Puppet and TFTP.

Part of the Foreman installer: http://github.com/theforeman/foreman-installer

## Compatibility

This module only supports Smart Proxy 1.6 or higher as of version 2.0, as the
configuration layout changed significantly.

To configure older versions of the Smart Proxy (1.5 or older), use an older
version of this module (1.x).
