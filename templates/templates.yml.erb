# Enable this if the Proxy should handle template requests on behalf of Foreman
# Can be true, false, or http/https to enable just one of the protocols
:enabled: <%= scope.lookupvar("foreman_proxy::templates") %>

# This plugin also requires that :foreman_url: be set in the main settings.yml
# This lets the plugin know how to obtain the templates from foreman.

# This allows the proxy to define how hosts that are being provisioned where to
# obtain the templates from. Most installers don't support https, so it's recommended
# to enable an http port listener in the main config file too, and use it in
# the url below
#
# :template_url is the URL the host should use to contact the proxy for a template.
# The default protocol is http on port 80 unless otherwise specified in the url.
# Examples:
# https://1.2.3.4:8443            # default proxy https port
# http://1.2.3.4:8000             # default proxy http port
# https://smart-proxy.example.com # assumes port 443
# http://smart-proxy.example.com  # assumes port 80
# smart-proxy.example.com:8080    # assumes http
:template_url: <%= scope.lookupvar("foreman_proxy::template_url") %>
